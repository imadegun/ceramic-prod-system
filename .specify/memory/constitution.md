# GayaProdSys Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Code
All code must adhere to clean code principles: meaningful names, single responsibility, DRY, small functions, comprehensive comments, and consistent formatting. Code reviews must enforce these standards to maintain readability and maintainability.

### II. Delightful User Experience
User interfaces must prioritize intuitive design, fast performance, accessibility, and responsive feedback. Every feature must enhance user satisfaction through thoughtful UX considerations, including error handling, loading states, and progressive enhancement.

## Development Standards

Technology stack: Next.js for frontend, Node.js for backend, TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling. All components must be reusable, tested, and documented.

## User Experience Standards

All user interactions must be validated for usability, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance), and performance (under 2s load times). User feedback must be collected and incorporated into iterative improvements.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require majority approval from core contributors, documentation of rationale, and migration plan. All PRs must verify compliance with clean code and UX principles. Complexity must be justified with user value. Use this constitution for runtime development guidance.
